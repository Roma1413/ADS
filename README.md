Project Overview

This Java project contains 10 practice problems covering topics like arrays, recursion, number theory, and basic algorithmic functions. Each problem is implemented in its own Java class, and all are run and tested via a single Main.java class.

The goal of this project is to build fundamental Java programming and algorithmic problem-solving skills.
✅ Problem 1: Find Minimum in an Array
	•	Function: findMinimum(int[] arr)
	•	Description: Scans the array to find the smallest number.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 2: Find Average of an Array
	•	Function: findAverage(int[] arr)
	•	Description: Computes the sum of all elements and divides by n.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 3: Check if a Number is Prime (Recursive)
	•	Function: isPrime(int n)
	•	Description: Recursively checks for divisors up to √n.
	•	Time Complexity: O(√n)

✅ Problem 4: Calculate Factorial using Recursion
	•	Function: factorial(int n)
	•	Description: Returns n! using standard recursive formula.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 5: Find n-th Fibonacci Number (Recursive)
	•	Function: fibonacci(int n)
	•	Description: Returns F(n) using recursive definition.
	•	Time Complexity: O(2^n) — exponential, not efficient for large n

✅ Problem 6: Calculate Power (a^n)
	•	Function: power(int a, int n)
	•	Description: Uses recursion to calculate base^exponent.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 7: Print Array in Reverse (Recursion Only)
	•	Function: reversePrint(int[] arr, int index)
	•	Description: Recursively prints array from end to start without using extra data structures.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 8: Check if String Contains Only Digits
	•	Function: isAllDigits(String s)
	•	Description: Loops through each character to verify it’s a digit.
	•	Time Complexity: O(n)

✅ Problem 9: Compute Binomial Coefficient (Recursive)
	•	Function: binomialCoefficient(int n, int k)
	•	Description: Computes C(n, k) using Pascal’s triangle recursion.
	•	Time Complexity: O(2^n) — exponential due to repeated calls

✅ Problem 10: Find GCD Using Euclidean Algorithm
	•	Function: gcd(int a, int b)
	•	Description: Uses recursion with modulo operation.
	•	Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))
